# churn-prediction

# ##Problem-Statement

The dataset contains the information like personal information of the customer, transaction information, and bank information belonging to a bank. It is often necessary to predict when the customers are going to withdraw their money from the bank account and stay dormant. Being able to predict this, the bank can take necessary action to prevent customers from withdrawing huge sums and stay an active/loyal customer. Our task is to be able to predict the customers who are going to churn based on the information given.


# ##Solution

Firstly finding and checking categorical data and seperating them.

doing Unvairiable Analysis of numerical data

making charts of related data to customer impact and removing outliers.

Analysing dependend from numerical as well as categorical data


Lastly using plots and logistic Regression model is prepared as well as I have given detailed info in jupyter file
